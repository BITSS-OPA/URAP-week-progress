# Summary for Spring 2022

## Weekly Tasks
### Week 1:
- Familiarized myself with the ACRE guide and read about the importance of reproducibility and how to reproduce papers.
- Watched BITSS recordings after the event to learn more about the reproduction process
### Week 2:
- Started the reproduction of the paper: __Trends in US Spatial Inequality__, understanding the paper and scoping the claims
### Week 3:
- Continued the reproduction of __Trends in US Spatial Inequality__, downloading the data set, learning Stata, and filling out the reproducibility evaluation tables. 
- Helped edit, cut and upload videos from the annual BITSS conference
### Week 4:
- Performed robustness checks on __Trends in US Spatial Inequality__, furthered my knowledge of Stata, and reproduced my first graphs and findings.
### Week 5: 
- Finished reproduction for __Trends in US Spatial Inequality__, finding bugs along the way and learned how to report them using the SSRP Forum and through opening GitHub issues.
### Week 6: 
- Started reproduction for __Income Segregation and Intergenerational Mobility__, locating the reproduction package, understanding the paper, and scoped the claims for the paper.
### Week 7: 
- Continued repriduction for __Income Segregation and Intergenerational Mobility__, running the basic Stata .do files for the paper and reproducing the first display items
### Week 8:
- Finished the rest of the reproduction for __Income Segregation and Intergenerational Mobility__, finishing the tree diagrams. Also started working on a directory scraper tool for ease of inputting data files in the SSRP.
### Week 9:
- Completed reproduction for __Income Segregation and Intergenerational Mobility__, and made the Python directory scraper tool more robust and easy to use, fixing bugs along the way.
### Week 10:
- Searched for paper to reproduce and settled upon __Completed reproduction for Communication infrastructure and Stablizing Food Prices__, read and understood paper in addition to scoping the paper. Also made minor improvements to the Python scraper.
### Week 11:
- Completed reproduction for __Completed reproduction for Communication infrastructure and Stablizing Food Prices__, evaluating the claims, running code, and building the tree diagrams. Also uploaded the first version of the Scraper tool to the SSRP Forum.
### Week 12:
- Created weekly report summary, provided suggestions for future semesters, and made suggestions for the GitHub SSRP guides.


## Ideas for future semesters
- More GitHub practice for URAPs to help with pushing, merging, and operating on different forks of the same repository.
- More Stata practice in the beginning of the semester to assist with understanding and debugging code.
- More guidance on helping understand some of the underlying economic papers and the methods and approaches they use would be helpful, but not a huge priority.
