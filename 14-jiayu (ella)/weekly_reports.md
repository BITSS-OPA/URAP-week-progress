## Week 5 (Oct 19 - 23) 

**Note: I will use a token next week.**
- Assigned Tasks
  - Continue to work on using Latex for the greek letter variables for the label of each sliderInput
  - Possible improvement of the shinyapp: when users scroll up the sliderInputs, it is easier to use if the "data" "research" and "GW" tabs stay there static.
  - Reposition Equations
- Completed Tasks
  - Attended weekly meeting
  - Had a meeting with Aleksandra to solve GitHub issues
  - Repositioned equations
- Work in Progress
  - Use Latex notation for labels
    - **Question: When I replaced lambda 1_1_new, lambda 1_2_new, and lambda 1_3_new with Lambda_KLPS, the graph errored. So I named each of them lambda_KLPS1, etc. What should I do about them?**
  - Found a possible solution to make tabs static on the internet, but couldn't succeffully make the code work in our shinyapp. I need more time to degug.

I worked for about 9.5 hours during week 5.
