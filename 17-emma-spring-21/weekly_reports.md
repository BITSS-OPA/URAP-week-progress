# Weekly reports of progress

## Week 1 (1/25)

##### Assigned tasks  
- Reinput pilot reproductions in social science reproduction platform  

##### Completed tasks
- Went over reproduction entries from last semester -- data seemed like it was all still there, so I mostly confirmed that the information was correct.

##### Notes
- Both Select a Paper and Scoping sections are locked (view only), can't change paper name

I worked 6 hours during Week 1.
