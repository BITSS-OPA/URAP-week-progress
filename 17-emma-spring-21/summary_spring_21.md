### Ideas for future semesters
- Continue reproduction of COVID-19 Economic Impacts. The Opportunity Insights team is open to future SSRP inquiries and one of the authors (Michael Stepner: michael.stepner@utoronto.ca) wrote in March that the data should be posted to a stable Dataverse DOI by May 2021.
- More Github practice for URAPs at the beginning of a semester: maybe practice creating issues, assigning to others
- Summer BITSS internships:
  - Dedicate time __in the fall semester__ for URAPs to look at summer internships and grants; add new information to policy analysis opportunities and summer funding tutorial
  - If possible, secure funding for URAPs to continue working over summer if (1) URAP funding is not available or (2) the URAP is not eligible for funding options in the summer funding tutorial.
