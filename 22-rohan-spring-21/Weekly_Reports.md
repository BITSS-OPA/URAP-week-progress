## Week 2 (2/22)
_______________
**Assigned Tasks:**  
Go over:
- Figure out a new way of scrolling through reproduction trees for ACRE guidelines
- Reread the DD and think of another way to account for the outlier of Swiss tax evasion data
- Get started on reproducing your first paper

**Finished Tasks:**
- Explored scrolling through reproduction trees for ACRE guidelines
- Thought of a new way to approach the outlier that is Swiss tax evasion data
- Read my first paper and got started on reproducing it

**Notes**
- I have a text file demonstrating horizontal scrolling but I have concluded that the amount of effort it takes to perform horizontal scrolling will probably not be worth the relatively small benefit it'll add to the ACRE guidelines.
- I think it might be helpful to reproduce the paper in 2 ways: one that takes an average of all the tax evasion data (like it is right now), and another one that disregards the Swiss data entirely as an outlier. Have 2 different analysis would likely result in a more comprehensive and convincing dataset. Additionally, this may be too much work/not possible, but I suspect the Swiss high tax evasion rate may be due to their strong banking privacy laws which result in more money laundering/tax evasion. Therefore, if we kept the same 4 countries but accounted for the amount of black money in their economies in some way, that may result in a more fruitful analysis.
- I'm not sure what's the Andrews and Kasy (2019) measurement of publication bias.
- I don't understand some of the study methods in the research paper (eg: DID, IV and RDD). I will likely be able to reproduce the paper without understanding them, but knowing what they are would be nice.
- Why are there differences between which study methods male and female authors use? Why are authors at 'top institutions' more likely to use RCTs? Which institutions come under 'top institutions'?
- I'm not sure how to determine how many claims there are in the paper, how to choose a claim and then how to reproduce one.

## Week 1 (2/15)
_______________
**Assigned Tasks:**  
Go over:
- OPA paper
- ACRE guidelines
- Rmarkdown tutorials
- Review wealth tax and dw app and DD
- Come up with questions (~10) then meet at the end of the week to discuss those questions. Submit unsolved questions in your weekly report so we can discuss during next meeting.

**Finished Tasks:**
- Read the OPA paper and ACRE guidelines
- Did tutorials/learnt basics of Git and Rmarkdown (thanks to Emma for helping me with Git)
- Reviewed wealth tax, deworming paper and evidenceaction.org.

**Notes**
- I will have a meeting with my fellow URAP peers on Friday at 5pm to review what we read and discuss our questions. Any unresolved questions can be brought up in the subsequent weekly meeting if necessary.
- While reviewing the [wealth tax simulator](http://wealthtaxsimulator.org/analysis/#7_-_visualization), I was unable to reproduce all the results of the code as the [project binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/fhoces/opa-wealthtax/master?urlpath=rstudio) took too long to load (even after I let it run for a while).

After the meeting with my URAP peers, I will have worked around ~8 hours in week 1.
