## Week 8 (4/26)
**Assigned Tasks:**
- Draft an email to Alice Wu detailing my reproduction.
- Write a summary document for the work done in the semester.
- Add to the BITSS tutorials if necessary.

**Finished Tasks:**
- Began drafting an email to Alice Wu, but realized I didn't have enough content for a proper email.
- Wrote the summary document for the semester.
- Added a folder and file to the BITSS tutorials with instructions for running Python files.

I worked around 3 hours in week 8.

## Week 7 (4/19)
**Assigned Tasks:**
- Fully finish reproducing gender bias paper; check if I can create a shell script to run all the files.
- Review and wrap up p-hacking paper.

**Finished Tasks:**
- Made a markdown file documenting my reproduction for the gender bias paper; could not succesfully make a shell script.
- Will review and wrap up p-hacking paper over the weekend.

By monday's meeting, I will have worked around 8 hours in week 7.

## Week 6 (4/12)
**Assigned Tasks:**
- Continue reproducing gender bias paper.

**Finished Tasks:**
- Re-reproduced the paper fully from raw data.
- Finished documenting my reproduction on the website.

**Notes**
- The diagram builder is marking some files as unused analytic data even though they were used.
- Would be super helpful if we could add multiple rows at once while doing the assessment stage. Also it takes a lot of scrolling if you're entering multiple files into the input/output column.

I worked around 10-12 hours in week 6.

## Week 5 (3/29)
**Assigned Tasks:**
- Continue reproducing gender bias paper

**Finished Tasks:** 
- Successfully reproduced a figure from the paper and got started on documenting my work (unfortunately, the documentation is not finished).

**Notes**
- I have a few questions regarding how I should document the data sources on the social sciences reproduction website that I'll ask during our next meeting.

I have currently worked around 6 hours in this week, but I do plan on doing more work over the weekend and will have done 8-10 hours of work by Monday's meeting.

## Week 4 (3/8)
**Assigned Tasks:**
 - Finish documenting the p-hacking reproduction.
 - Read the gender bias paper and begin reproducing it.

 **Finished Tasks:**
 - Finished the p-hacking reproduction documentation.
 - Began reading gender bias paper.

 **Notes**
 - While I'm not done with deciding the claims of the paper yet, I will get more work done over the weekend so I'm ready to properly discuss the paper on our Monday meeting.
 - I couldn't find a reproduction package for the paper's data. This prevented me from being able to fully enter the paper on the social sciences reproduction website.
 - What if we find some of the EJMR statistics interesting and worth duplicating?

 By Monday's meeting, I will have worked around 6-8 hours in week 4.

## Week 3 (3/1)
**Assigned Tasks:** 
- Continue reproducing the p-hacking paper

**Finished Tasks:**
- Continued reproducing the p-hacking paper as much as I could.

**Notes**
- On the social sciences reproduction website, I couldn't progress past the scoping stage because I wasn't comfortable with submitting everything in the scoping stage (eg: robustness checks, all tables needed to reproduce for claim).
- What do I do if readme file isn't fully accurate (eg: make setup.do was actually setup.do).
- Some packages aren't getting installed properly.
- Super long run times on stata.

I have currently worked around 5-6 hours in week 3, although I may get more work done during the weekend.

## Week 2 (2/22)
**Assigned Tasks:**  
- Figure out a new way of scrolling through reproduction trees for ACRE guidelines
- Reread the DD and think of another way to account for the outlier of Swiss tax evasion data
- Get started on reproducing your first paper

**Finished Tasks:**
- Explored scrolling through reproduction trees for ACRE guidelines
- Thought of a new way to approach the outlier that is Swiss tax evasion data
- Read my first paper and got started on reproducing it (did come of the initial assessment and scoping of the paper, including downloading and cloning the data)

**Notes**
- I have a text file demonstrating horizontal scrolling but I have concluded that the amount of effort it takes to perform horizontal scrolling will probably not be worth the relatively small benefit it'll add to the ACRE guidelines.
- I think it might be helpful to reproduce the paper in 2 ways: one that takes an average of all the tax evasion data (like it is right now), and another one that disregards the Swiss data entirely as an outlier. Have 2 different analysis would likely result in a more comprehensive and convincing dataset. Additionally, this may be too much work/not possible, but I suspect the Swiss high tax evasion rate may be due to their strong banking privacy laws which result in more money laundering/tax evasion. Therefore, if we kept the same 4 countries but accounted for the amount of black money in their economies in some way, that may result in a more fruitful analysis.
- I looked up the Andrews and Kasy (2019) measurement of publication bias, but I'm still not sure what it is.
- I didn't understand some of the study methods in the research paper (eg: DID, IV and RDD), and so I researched them.
- Why are there differences between which study methods male and female authors use? Why are authors at 'top institutions' more likely to use RCTs? Which institutions come under 'top institutions'?
- I'm not sure how to determine the number of claims in a paper, choose a claim and then reproduce one.
- I can't seem to open lot of the files I got from the cloned repository.

I worked around 9-10 hours in week 2.

## Week 1 (2/15)
**Assigned Tasks:**  
Go over:
- OPA paper
- ACRE guidelines
- Rmarkdown tutorials
- Review wealth tax and dw app and DD
- Come up with questions (~10) then meet at the end of the week to discuss those questions. Submit unsolved questions in your weekly report so we can discuss during next meeting.

**Finished Tasks:**
- Read the OPA paper and ACRE guidelines
- Did tutorials/learnt basics of Git and Rmarkdown (thanks to Emma for helping me with Git)
- Reviewed wealth tax, deworming paper and evidenceaction.org.

**Notes**
- I will have a meeting with my fellow URAP peers on Friday at 5pm to review what we read and discuss our questions. Any unresolved questions can be brought up in the subsequent weekly meeting if necessary.
- While reviewing the [wealth tax simulator](http://wealthtaxsimulator.org/analysis/#7_-_visualization), I was unable to reproduce all the results of the code as the [project binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/fhoces/opa-wealthtax/master?urlpath=rstudio) took too long to load (even after I let it run for a while).

After the meeting with my URAP peers, I will have worked around ~8 hours in week 1.
