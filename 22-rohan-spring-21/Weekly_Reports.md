**Finished Tasks:**

**Notes**
- I will have a meeting with my fellow URAP peers on Friday at 5pm to review what we read and discuss our questions. Any unresolved questions can be brought up in the subsequent weekly meeting if necessary.
- While reviewing the [wealth tax simulator](http://wealthtaxsimulator.org/analysis/#7_-_visualization), I was unable to reproduce all the results of the code as the [project binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/fhoces/opa-wealthtax/master?urlpath=rstudio) took too long to load (even after I let it run for a while).

After the meeting with my URAP peers, I will have worked around ~8 hours in week 1.
