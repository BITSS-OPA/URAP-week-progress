## Spring 2021 Summary

**Week 1:** Read the OPA paper, ACRE guidelines, weath tax and DD. Noted down any questions I had during this process and had a meeting with my peers to help answer these questions.
**Week 2:** Explored how to scroll through reproduction trees for the ACRE guidelines, read the p-hacking paper and got started on reproducing it.
**Week 3:** Continued reproducing the p-hacking paper, but wasn't sure on how to properly document the reproduction on the socialsciencesreproduction website.
**Week 4:** Finished documenting the p-hacking paper plus read and decided on claims for the gender bias paper.
**Week 5:** Drop week.
**Week 6:** Reproduced a figure in the p-hacking paper from the analytic data + began documenting my reproduction.
**Week 7:** Drop week.
**Week 8:** Reproduced a figure in the p-hacking fully from the raw data + finished documenting my reproduction on the website.
**Week 9:** Reviewed the website documentation for both the p-hacking and gender bias papers, ensuring everything was documented approproiately. Also retried to reproduce p-hacking paper, but wasn't successful once again. Also tried to create a shell script to automatically run all the files in the gender bias reproduction, but wasn't succesful.
**Week 10:** Began drafting an email about the gender bias reproduction to Alice Wu (the author of the paper) but ultimately decided not to send it. Also created the summary file and added to the OPA github tutorials.
