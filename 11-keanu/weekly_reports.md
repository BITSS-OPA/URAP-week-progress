#Weekly Reports of Progress



## Week 2 (10/2/20)

**Assigned Tasks:**
- Review OPA readme on deworming
- Run DW OPA Shiny app

**Completed Tasks:**
- Reviewed OPA readme on Deworming

**Work in Progress:**
- Reviewing DW Shiny App

**Questions/Notes on DW DD:**
- Packages did not automatically install when knitting DW DD. Not sure if this is an error on my end, wondering if others had similar experiences.
- Investigated Half-line break note on line 383 and found this stack overflow [discussion](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24467036/make-a-half-row-break-br)
- Section 2.1.1.1 of DD would benefit from variable definition that happens just above it in 2.1.1
  - In general, I think variables would be more useful/readable if defined like this (Maybe eliminate need for Appendix in readme?)
- Section 2.1.1.2: Are the proportions of male/female 1/2 each respectively?
- Summary tables at intermittent points in the DD sort of overwhelming?
- Feels like definition of equations reversed. Components of equations are broken down after final equations are shown. Feels counter intutive to me but not sure what standard practice is.
- References in DD missing links to papers:
  - [Baird et al.](http://emiguel.econ.berkeley.edu/research/worms-at-work-long-run-impacts-of-a-child-health-investment)
  - [Hamory et al.](https://www.nber.org/papers/w27611)
  - [Kremer](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/evaluation/illusion-sustainability-comparing-free-provision-deworming-drugs-and-other-sustainable)

**Questions/Notes on DW Shiny App:**
- Binder link in opa-deworming repo leads to wealth tax Shiny App
- Can take-up parameter in Research sub-menu of All Assumptions menu exceed 1?
