***Completed Task:***
* Fixed the main plot text display

**ALL THE COMPLETE WORK & WORK IN PROGRESS IS IN branch `shinyAppAesthetics`**

***Work in Progress:***
* Create tutorial/readme for dynamic documents
  + Wrote detailed tutorial up to 2.1.1.1 
  + Met with Emma twice throughout the week to discuss / Q & A
  + TO-DO:
    - Complete Appendix A & B
    - Figure out how to add latex in ".md" extension

***QUESTIONS:***
* Could we schedule a time to go over the tutorial? I have a couple of questions about how it should look and also some questions about the dynamic document itself:
  - Why is every chunk of code before "Part 3 Main Results" in an overarching function `chunk_xxx()`? I noticed that these `chunk_xxx()` fucntions are not called in the main results when we are trying to render the plot.
  - What's the point of `invisible(list2env(...))`?
  - For `wage_t_mo_f()`, what's the definition of beta hat?
  - Should I put the code tracker that tracks different outputs/functions at the very end with the abbreviation appendix or is it fine to leave it where it is right now?
  ## Week 4 9/8 - 9/11

  _**Assigned Task:**_
  * (first create a branch of this repo, then) add dynamic text on prevalence and costs
  * Modify the aesthetics of the app. Make it as simple as possible, and improve user experience
  * Learn about the observe function for shiny, build a simple example (in a different repo).
  * Take notes as you learn how to edit this OPA. Identify things you need to know, and the answer once you figure it out. Then turn this notes into a tutorial.

  _**Completed Task:**_
  * Created branch `shinyAppAesthetics` and pushed updated shinyApp and readme.md
  * Fixed picture format for Tutorials
  * Added dynamic text under costs and prevalence
    + Put placeholders for costs because I wasn't sure if I found the right one
    + Rounded the inputs so that it only shows 2 decimal digits
  * Updates to the Shiny App plots
    + Wrapped the code rendering the plot in a function so we don't have to copy and paste it for every plot
    + Adjusted the plot style using the `theme()` function
    + Adjusted the xlim for each plot
  * Learned about the `observe()` function and built [a simple example](https://github.com/AleksandraMaa/Notes/blob/master/shinyApp/observeExample/app.R) (still work in progress to complicate it a bit more, but understood how it works)
  * Created [`Steps2Unfold.md`](https://github.com/AleksandraMaa/Notes/blob/master/Steps2Unfold.md) : ongoing task
    + Added how I unfolded the OPA from my experience
    + Put down some ideas how we can simplify things


## Week 3 8/31 - 9/4

  _**Assigned Task:**_
  * Submit readme.md as a Public Pull Request

  * Submitted all the tutorials (all 5 .md files) as PR
  * Read wealth tax opa related files
  * Read deworming OPA related files
