- Perform SSRP reproduction of Gender Bias paper

**Completed Tasks**
- Link to [reproduction](https://www.socialsciencereproduction.org/reproductions/78a5f08a-78e4-439e-b818-8a0dcf744de0/index)
- Finished scoping

**WIP**
- Finishing assessment portion of SSRP over the weekend

**Notes**

_Issues with SSRP_
- I checked 'attempted to count all figures' but when I reviewed the scoping it does not indicate this
- Problems creating GitHub repo due to large file sizes (could not find a solution to this so still local)
- I decided to add a claim and the platform deleted one of my claims which was somewhat frustrating

I've worked 6 hours so far this week. I plan to work at least another 3 over the weekend to finish the assessment portion. I'll be using my 1st token next week though I plan on attending Monday's meeting as to not fall too far behind.

## Week 6 (3/5/21)

**Assigned Tasks**
- Ensure Wealth Tax OPA complies w/ format of DW OPA
- Propose a way to incorporate open report and data previous

**Completed Tasks**
- Forked wealth tax repo and made edits to Wealth Tax DD to match format of DW OPA
  - Link to [repo](https://github.com/keanulim123/opa-wealthtax). Click github page link to easily access the DD

**WIP**
- Trying to find a way to make main visualization/policy estimate easily reproducible. There doesn't seem to be an easy way to export the ggvis plot and I haven't found any resources to do so without an external application (may be harder for individuals to reproduce).
- Currently working w/ Gabriel and Sreeja on finding relevant chunks from Wealth Tax DD to import to an all_analysis file. Such implementation seems like it would require extensive work on server element of existing Wealth Tax visualization.

I worked 9-10 hours this week
