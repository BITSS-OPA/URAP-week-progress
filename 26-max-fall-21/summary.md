- Week 2: Reviewed `04` to `05a` script files, revised comments
- Week 3: Reviewed README, ran through `01` to `05a`, started translating `00`, `01`
- Week 4: Reviewed `05a`, `05b` and revised comments and added unit tests, updated README
- Week 5: Redevelop unit tests for `02`, `04`, `05` (`03` already updated)
- Week 6: Created minimal example of slide deployment, met with Gabriel for Stata review
- Week 7: Summarized `05a`, `05b` code, fixed `02`, `03`, `04`, `05` unit tests
- Week 8: Partially reviewed `07a`, `07b`, watched `ipumsr` webinar
- Week 9: Token week---had a midterm and also had to move out :(
- Week 10: Reviewed and summarized `07a`, `07b`, resumed translation of `01`
- Week 11: Continued translation of `01`, researched R-oriented unit tests
- Week 12: Continued translation of `01`, reformatted and fixed bugs
- Week 13: Finish translation of `01` including unit tests, but bug testing needed
- Week 14: Thanksgiving break---fixed Stata `bsample` bug and implemented fix in R
- Week 15: Finish debugging `01.R`
- Week 16: RRR week---update `01.R` based on recent changes from James: entire script is working!

## Ideas for future semesters

- For projects that will involve translation between languages, i.e. Stata to R, if an apprentice is unfamiliar with one of the languages they should do translation very early so that they can apply their knowledge of one language to learn the other. I found translating `01` from Stata to R much more helpful in teaching me the functionality and syntax of Stata than just reviewing `01` and the other script files alone.
- Unit tests are really interesting, and if apprentices will be working with unit tests I think the idea behind them and their role in reproducible code should be introduced earlier and somewhat formally!
- If possible, more direct communication with BIFYA (or other organizations we're working with) would be good! It wasn't always clear what they were working on and how we fit into it.
