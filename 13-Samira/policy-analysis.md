Main Benefits
The program is underfunded and only one out of four households eligible for rent assistance receive it. With efficient funding, over time 17 million low-income families will access assistance. 
Biden will enact a law prohibiting landlords from discriminating against renters receiving federal housing benefits. 

Main Costs
Biden will invest $640 billion over ten years by raising taxes on corporations and large financial institutions. Specifically, approximately $300 billion of the housing plan is devoted to new construction and is encompassed in the $3.1 trillion infrastructure plan. The remaining portion is paid by instituting a financial fee on certain liabilities of firms with over $50 billion in assets.
