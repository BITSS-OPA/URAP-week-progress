  - **Notes: The sample repository is my scratch work based off my understanding. If I'm working in the wrong direction or need to improve on anything I'm very prepared to do so! I made the repository private because of this. Once it's approved I will collect all real repos into one centralized repo. My tutorial will also be adjusted along with the improvement.**
