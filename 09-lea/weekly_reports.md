## Week 4 (10/12)
- Using one of my "tokens" for this week due to academic overload.
 
## Week 3 (10/5)
#### Assigned Tasks
- Revise & continue work on policy debate analysis
    - focus on explaining the policy issue first.   
    - What about the fossil fuels business as supporters of CC?
    - Where in IPCC exactly can you find the analysis on CC?
    - Clarify costs presented by supporters. No costs? Hard to measure? Other?
    - Try to get the units of benefit (GtCO2) and costs ($) to be the same across supporters and opponents. If not possible explain why.
- Follow up with Nasir's inquiry into George Washington University's policy research database

#### Completed Tasks
- Clarified policy debate/issue
- Added to list of supporters: Fossil Fuel companies who benefit from CC tech.  
- Could not find costs presented *by* supporters, but there are risks and costs discussed in the report *presented* by the supporters. Clarified and added some of those.
- Got units of costs/benefit to be standardized across supporters and opponents in GtC02, but was not able to find a comprehensive estimate for global added C02 due to EOR, only for the United States. Could not find clean, specific economic benefits.
- After reading through IPCC document extensively and arduously, finally found a citation of a document solely focused on CCS done by the IPCC in 2005. Was too late in process to start reading, but this paper would be a better source of evidence/opposition arguments.  
- Followed up with GW database inquiry; spoke with agent at GW about possible access grant, who passed me along on email to people who could possibly help. Waiting for reply.

- I worked 10 hours this week.



## Week 2  (9/28)
#### Assigned Tasks
- Find policy debate of interest
- Find supporting and opposing groups involved in debate
- Find evidence of both sides citing evidence as reasons for position
- Find the cited papers and search through for actual numerical examples of evidential arguments
- Synthesize and summarize papers/findings (benefits and losses of policy initiatives)

#### Tasks Completed
- Found first interesting policy debate - the movement to have governments lessen and eventually cease the practice of subsidizing fossil fuel companies.
- extensively searched for different views and sides of the issue, for around 2 hours and had trouble identifying actual sides and positions due to the complexity of the issue and the many competing interests. As a debate it is relevant to OPA due to the disagreements of economic and environmental projections, but was too hard to find and lock down specific sides and articles.
- Switched to the debate of subsidizing carbon-capture technology, which is controversial due to the ways that the fossil fuel industry benefit from carbon-sequestering technology; many argue that this type of technology just acts to preserve and elongate the lifespan of the fossil fuel industry.
- Found many supporting groups based on a number of letters and petitions
- Found evidence of each side citing evidence of projections
- Read through cited papers to look for the evidence people are using as arguments (harder to find explicitly)
- Summarized findings

##### NOTE:
- Got too excited, mistakenly forgot about the WSJ/NYT rule for researching these topics; I circled back and found evidence of the debates in NYT, however not as much clear indications of different sides referencing specific research papers, which I could only find on other pages.

- I worked 10 hours this week.

## Week 1 (9/21)

## Tasks completed
- Familiarized self with Github, read through some of the tutorials
- made folder named "09-Lea"
- Had call with Emma and Lauren getting help with Github - still struggling but getting used to the interface
- looked through interface on OPA site
- Read articles:
   - On the CBO Report - "Minimum Wage Options Summary"
#### Found interesting:
        - teenage workers can be payed less by law
        - it is not the wage itself but wage PLUS tips that must exceed minimum wage - how is this done and calculated, given that while wage should be constant tips are not?
        - disabled workers can be payed less due to "worker productivity"; I understand the monetary reason behind this but to me it feels ethically problematic
        - did not realize that raising minimum wage could have such vast negative effects in addition to the positive, throwing certain families below poverty line
#### Found confusing/still have questions:
        - why wouldn't the "indexing of the minimum wage and the elimination of exceptions" not impact the response to the $12 or $10 options, and only the $15 dollar option? is it that it would, but it would be more negligible?
        - in the "conclusions" section, what does the 2/3 change confidence level mean in the context of the 1.3 million workers becoming jobless?
        - says that the 'number of people with an annual income below the poverty threshold in 2025 would fall by 1.3 million', but didn't it say before that it would RISE by 1.3 million? was confused by this exchange.


  - On the letter to Liz Warren by Saez and Zucman
####  Found interesting:
        - I remember hearing Elizabeth Warren on a podcast with Ezra Klein talking about her ideas and I remember her mentioning this. I remember when she came out with this plan with the exact numbers and marveling at her calculations - now I know that it was Berkeley professors who conducted that study!!!!
        - not surprising but still shocking every time I see the actual numbers representing the amount of wealth held by the top 0.1%.
  - On the OPA paper (by Fernando Hoces de la Guardia)
#### Found interesting:
      - in general, it seems that the powerful academics in our society are never truly questioned - credibility seems to come with the title of "researcher" or "professor" or "analyst" already; thus, I never realized how the evidence informing any sort of policy could be so biased and convoluted. it is shocking in nature, but makes this work so much more important.
      - I find it interesting considering how the "degrees of freedom" concept relates to different settings/socio-economic statures/prioritization of certain areas of study over others. Thought - because policy analysis has not followed the Open Science methodology and practice, it is not given enough attention or is seen as needing as much funding as, for example, a study on String Theory or Artificial Intelligence. (How does funding and the perception of the research/the fields themselves play into research.)
#### Questions/found confusing:
      - what is the root cause of the "publish or perish" phenomenon in academia?
      - how do you rebuild trust in evidence-based policy research when it for so long has catered to activism, lobbying, etc?
      - on page 5, writes, "Policy Analysis aspires to the rigor and neutrality of scientific empirical analysis." Does it truly? If standard practice in some circles of academia and evidence-based policy research has always been to skew and bias research to cater certain ways, how can you say that all policy analysis aspires to said "neutrality"? And how can we expect the analysts who have been doing that for such a long time (and benefitting from their willingness to go along with otherwise unethical research practice) to want to suddenly change their ways?
