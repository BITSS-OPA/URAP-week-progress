 Ideas for Future Semesters
-----------------------------

- For projects involving a language that future apprentices are unfamiliar with, tutorials for basic understanding and application are necessary at an early stage. 
- More group communication would be appreciated for projects that may be helpful with group cooperation. Apprentices should be more ready to present the week's effort with an organized outline for each week's meeting.
