### Questions/Thoughts

- bigger picture/historical context of open science and open policy analysis?
- commit vs pull request vs push request
- forks vs branches
- how do policy makers actually interact with final output?
- wealth tax app suggestions
    - clear visual/verbal indication of what you are allowed to change and what effect that has
    - guide/refresher of what certain components mean (dropdown info menus)
        - intro to models, parameters, etc.?
    - revise graph?
    - conceptual explanation (and practical guide?) for git/github
- winners and losers after change to OPA (think 172 botswana paper)
- acre guidelines:
    - indented lists in ch4-5?
    - better way to display extremely long reproduction tree?
- wealth tax DD:
    - `return( sapply( ls(pattern= "_so\\b"), function(x) get(x) ) )` what does this line do
    - 1% addl tax on billionaires: 2% of wealth above 50mn + 1% of wealth above 1bn?
    - get_tax_rev function
    - edits? typos, more comments, etc. (or is wealth tax a finished project)
    - section 6 tests (how do these work?)
