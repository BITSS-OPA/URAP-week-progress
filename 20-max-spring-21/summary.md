### Ideas for future semesters

- designate times for (new) URAPs to collaborate on reproductions so they can discuss questions/issues, especially technical ones
- add images from the SSRP website to the ACRE guidelines to make each step more clear
  - more advice for 'edge cases', i.e. what to do when the paper you're reproducing doesn't quite fit the template on SSRP
