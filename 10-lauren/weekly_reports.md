# Weekly Reports
## Week 3 (10/5)

#### Assigned Tasks
- Proposition 19 Policy Analyses Report

#### Completed Tasks
- Proposition 19 Policy Analyses Report

#### Questions
1. The reports by the Legislative Analyst Office of California seem to provide generalizations in their quantifiable evidence. Is it okay to include quantification such as "tens of millions of dollars" rather than exact percentages?
2. What should we make of both sides citing the same policy reports? I am assuming this is a good thing, and they are interpreting it differently/holding out certain information. 

I worked 9 hours this week.

## Week 2 (9/28)
#### Notes on meeting
- use WSJ or NYT for newspaper
- for each main group, record the policy report and identify benefits and costs described in the report
- use units and qualitative assessment (increase in income of 10%)

#### Assigned Tasks
- Investigate how to access main page of NYT and WSJ of previous dates - upload a tutorial
- policy analysis tutorial for PPRO

#### Completed Tasks
- uploaded tutorial on accessing NYT and WSJ main pages
  - still trying to update the photos, my code chunks are not behaving (even with Aleksandras help), spent awhile on tutorials
- worked through the Evictions Moratorium in SF policy report
  - Found legal lawsuits and government press releases (city and state level), however this was challenging in terms of finding policy rather than legal documents.
- began policy report search on another policy discussion (that has policy analysis involved)

#### Questions
- N/A

#### Questions
- __*OPA paper:*__ How does open output promise that cherry picking would not happen? It seems that assuming cherry picking wouldn't happen from a clear concise final conclusion is difficult to promise. (How do you consolidate the opposing and agreeing sides into one open output?)

I worked 10 hours this week.
