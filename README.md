# Reports of progress
Each week, you are expected to complete/attempt your assigned tasks and update your report of progress, located in a folder at [this repository](https://github.com/BITSS-OPA/URAP-week-progress) _(See folders 05 and after for format examples)_. **The deadline for submitting your weekly report of progress is Friday 5pm.** Reports will be reviewed during the weekend to assign further tasks. If a report is submitted after the deadline, it will be reviewed for the week after. Reports should be summited as a pull request.     
As a minimum requirement to obtain a pass grade, URAPs must submit at least 8 good reports during a semester. A good report must contain three elements: (1) list of assigned tasks, (2) list of progress and questions in each task, (3) number of hours worked during the week. The following are some examples of good and bad:
  - Good examples: learned git, learned R, learned about PA, summarized # reports, pushed # commits, clean shiny app code, support a fellow URAP, etc.
  - Bad examples: apologies, promises, comments, etc. Will be counted as not submitted.
