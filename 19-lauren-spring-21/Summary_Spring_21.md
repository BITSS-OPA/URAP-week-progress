### Ideas for future URAP semesters
* training on specific challenges to using citrix (as seen in Max's tutorial)
* mention that there is programming knowledge required in URAP application (I think those with this knowledge have more productive experiences in URAP. However, it is a great way to expose people who are new to programming.)
* continue Slack or other communication channel for URAP to discuss issues they have
