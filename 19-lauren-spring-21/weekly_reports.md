### (Content confusion)
- "Our main policy estimate predicts that a mass deworming intervention will have a net present value (comparison of stream of benefits and costs from todayâ€™s perspective) of 289.8 for a setting with average prevalence and average unit costs (among the countries for which Evidence Action has data)."
  - this was challenging to read / there are no units on the number so not sure what units this is referring to
- general comment: should there be currency units on each of the results?
