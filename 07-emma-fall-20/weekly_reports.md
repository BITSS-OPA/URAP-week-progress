# Weekly reports of progress

## Week 8 (10/12)

##### Assigned Tasks
- Add to follow up sections in UBI report
- work with Lauren to draft language for policy analyst email
	- note: asking questions to get PAs to respond in the most standardized form possible
- prop 22 report

##### Completed Tasks
- worked with lauren on [PA email template](https://github.com/BITSS-OPA/policy-analysis-registry/blob/master/template_email.md)
	- Lauren found an issue with copying and pasting template into an email: BITSS link goes to repo and not BITSS website; the only solution I can think of right now is to add a note in the template_email.md file to copy from the raw file and paste into your email, then edit manually.
- Added to follow up section in UBI report
- Worked with Lauren on updating forked repo/ updating Xcode on Mac
- Started policy analysis report on Prop 22, did not finish

##### Completed Tasks

##### Questions
- re: Lauren's report on SF Eviction Moratorium - how do we approach evidence for a policy issue that is still evolving, or that might not have an analytical study yet?
- re: my report on UBI - unsure if opposition directly cites the PWBM dynamic modeling on UBI report, or if the url I included is referencing a different PWBM report.

## Week 5 (9/21)

##### Deworming OPA
