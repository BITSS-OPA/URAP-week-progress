# Weekly reports of progress

## Week 1 (8/26)

##### Deworming OPA
- emailed Ted to verify source of take-up rates without subsidy in Kremer and Miguel 2007
  - edited body but not bibliography file to include new source: Miguel and Kremer (2004) Table III and footnote 18
- edited readme: changed order of gh contributors to number of contributions, added CRediT roles

##### Draft onboarding package for new URAPs
- Created draft readme for a new repository 'onboarding_ras', will add links to online tutorials and useful tutorials in BITSS-OPA/tutorials
  - What other materials should be added? Should they be deworming OPA specific or accommodate for future OPAs?

I worked 10 hours during Week 1.  

## Week 2 (9/2)

##### Onboarding package for new URAPs
- Added links to tutorials; during weekly meeting check source of Saez and Zucman letter, link to 2016 Deworming paper section 5, and figure out categories for extra links.

##### Deworming OPA

## Week 4 (9/14)

##### Deworming OPA
- Helped Aleksandra clarify questions for dynamic doc readme
